# 🎨 Colour Trade Pro

🚨 **Disclaimer:** Colour trading is illegal in India — this project was built purely for **learning purposes**.  

A full-stack simulation of a colour trading game I built to explore **real-time trading logic, wallet systems, and how house-edge scams actually work**.

## ⏱️ Core Features
1. A **60-second global timer** synced across all users.  
2. Users can **trade once per round**, with all trades processed when the timer ends.  
3. Choose a **colour (Red, Green, Violet)** and a **number (0-9)**, place a trade, and later view your trade history on the **trade-history page**.  
4. Fully functional **wallet system** with deposit, withdrawal (to bank), and one **linked bank account**.  
5. **Profile management** with image upload via **Cloudinary**.  
6. **Influenced outcomes** using a **house-edge algorithm** (scam logic simulation).  
7. A full **Admin Dashboard** where the admin can view all user data and block wallets.
